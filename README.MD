# BibrChemistry


For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was Chemistry.

- Safety First.
- So Raph's got safety goggles on.
- They got partially melted in  a previous accident, that's why they don't really look like safety goggles.
- Also he probably drunk something super weird and that's why he moves like that.
- Something super, super weird and that's why he's possibly floating.

# Blender Bit
- Nothing interesting here tbh?
- Cables are just curves converted to meshes? That's useful if you don't know it.
- Cables? Gas goes in pipes doesn't it?
- Named things so I can select them in three easily ( luckily did not need to access the ca-pipes)

# JS Bit
- Basically three.js Raycaster to find button.
- Button moves with GSAP.
- Changes material on little flame.
- GSAP a uniform to change the shader.
- Same nonsense in reverse if you press it again.
_ Booelan that changes at the start and end of the animation to stop you double pressing
